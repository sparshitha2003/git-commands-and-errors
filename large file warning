Using Git LFS:

Install Git LFS:

git lfs install


git lfs track "calories_model"
Commit the changes:

git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Track large file using Git LFS"
git push




output

How It Works:
The pointer file is stored in your Git repository.
The actual large file is stored in a separate LFS server or storage backend (e.g., GitHub LFS storage).
When someone clones the repository and has Git LFS installed, the placeholder file is replaced with the actual large file during the checkout process.
